# June Web Audio Experiment

This is a privacy-first technical proof of concept exploring the limits of in-browser audio transcription using Web Audio API and Transformers.js.

## Key Features
- **100% Local**: All processing happens on your device. No audio data is ever uploaded to a server.
- **Privacy**: Your data stays private.
- **Simplicity**: Single-pass transcription for maximum stability.

## Limitations
- **Short Audio Only**: Strictly limited to files under 2 minutes to ensure browser stability.
- **Browser Support**: Best experienced on desktop Chrome or Edge (WebGPU/WASM support required).

**Note**: This is a learning exercise and a scoped experiment, not a production-ready tool.
